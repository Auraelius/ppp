      <h3>About Us</h3>

      <p >
        <strong>We rescue pianos and put them on the street for everybody to play.</strong>
      </p>

      <h3>About this app</h3>

      <p>This app helps you find and enjoy our public pianos on the streets of Portland. You can share your experiences with your friends on Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook.</p>

      <h3>Location services</h3>

      <p>Please turn on location services for this app so we can help you find the pianos. The maps won't work, otherwise. We won't run down your batteries, honest!</p>

      <h3>Notifications</h3>

      <p>Please allow notifications from this app so we can let you know when new pianos appear on the streets. If you opt-in to
        <strong>Piano Radar</strong> we'll send you a notification when you get close to one of the pianos. We won't bug you other than that, don't worry.</p>

      <h3>Sign up for more stuff</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>You don't need to sign up to find and enjoy pianos.</strong> If you
        <strong>do</strong> decide to sign up, we can help you keep track of which pianos you've been to. We can also send you more information about our pianos and make sure you hear about our upcoming free concerts. Best of all, you can also win cool stuff
        by visiting and "claiming" pianos. </p>

      <p>Just use the menu and select "Sign Up" to get started.</p>

      <h3>Privacy</h3>

      <p>You have to sign up and create an account to use some of the more fancy features of the app (like radar or leaderboards).
        <strong>We don't share your email or location with anybody, under any circumstances.</strong> You can opt-in to let us publish your name (but not email) on our web site when you claim a piano or win stuff, but other than that we won't ever tell anybody
        anything about you. </p>

      <p>If you tag a shared photo with
        <strong>#pianopushplay</strong> you may see your photo on our web site.</p>

      <p>We
        <strong>do</strong> want to know how many people enjoy the pianos, so we will publish anonymous counts of people who visit the pianos.</p>
